I decided to make the snake game for my OOP final project plan.
I chose this game because I used to play it all the time when I was a kid.
For this game, I plan on making a snake where we can control it to move around.
By moving it around I mean that we can control it to move to eat its food.
And for the food, I haven’t decided yet whether I’m gonna make it like the classic bubble
or make it shaped like a fruit. Each time the snake eats the food, it will grow longer and longer
until it can fill up the entire game screen. But, if the snake hit its own body, you will lose the game.
So, we have to be careful and try to eat as many foods as we can without hitting our own body.
And we will win if the body is already long enough to cover the entire screen and can’t move
anywhere anymore.
